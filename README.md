## BuzzBites

BuzzBites is for anyone searching for awesome restaurants, just a short walk away. You don't need to go on Foursquare, Twitter, or Instagram: It's all here on BuzzBites! 

Get first-hand accounts on what folks are saying about restaurants you're curious about. Check out posts on Twitter and Instagram about the trending restaurants around you, or enter a zip code for restaurants in an area you're curious about. Take all the guesswork, research, and planning out of your group dinner outings. Got a date? Bring them to a special spot. Brunch with the inlaws? Impress them with your knowledge of the neighborhood eateries.


Our development team used a variety of technologies to create this full stack application: 
- Ruby on Rails version 4.2.6 and PostgresQL
- GeoLocation, Google Maps, Twitter, Foursquare, and Instagram APIs
- Numerous gems including Twitter, HTTParty, and Figaro
- Trello for progress tracking: https://trello.com/b/LoDBZMzJ/foodie-faddies
- GitHub (obviously) for version control
- Agile approach for meetings
